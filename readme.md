This is just to track what I have learned while following this tutorial on MERN stack realtime chat app 

A. backend setup
    1. npm init -y to initialize the project
    2. install dependencies :
        "bcryptjs": "^3.0.2",
        "cloudinary": "^2.6.1",
        "cookie-parser": "^1.4.7",
        "dotenv": "^16.5.0",
        "express": "^5.1.0",
        "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
        "mongoose": "^8.15.1",
        "socket.io": "^4.8.1"
    3. create entry file "index.js"
B. Creating the authentication:
    1. Create some folders:
        controllers
        lib
        models
        routes
        src
    2. create login logout and signup routes, and test them. 
    3. seperate the logic into the "controllers" folder. This simplifies the code readabliity.
